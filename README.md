# ack

A simple [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function that normalizes and sends an incoming payload to an [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) topic, while acknowledging back to the sender ASAP.

This is designed to work with [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), returning a 200 OK response as soon as possible to satisfy impatient webhook callers such as Slack's [Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands).

**THIS FUNCTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS NOT READY FOR USE YET.**
